  "app/__init__.py": "It looks like you want a summary of a Python file, but unfortunately, I can't view the content of files directly. If you could either describe its functions or share relevant code snippets, I'd be happy to help summarize its purpose and key functions!",
  "app/github_client.py": "The purpose of this Python file is to interact with the GitHub API to list the top-level files in a specified GitHub repository. \n\n### Key Functions:\n1. **Authentication**: It uses an environment variable (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) to authenticate with GitHub.\n2. **Repository Access**: It utilizes the `Github` class from the `PyGithub` library to access a repository.\n3. **File Listing**: The `list_repo_files` function retrieves and returns a list of the top-level files in the given repository.\n\nThis function can be useful for quickly viewing the contents of a repository without cloning it locally.",
  "app/logger_config.py": "The provided Python file is designed to set up a logging system for an application, specifically named \"devmate.\" Here\u2019s a summary of its purpose and key functions:\n\n### Purpose\nTo establish a logging mechanism that records information about the running application, both in a log file and to the console.\n\n### Key Functions\n1. **Directory Creation**:\n   - Checks and creates a `logs` directory if it doesn't exist to store log files.\n\n2. **Logger Configuration**:\n   - Initializes a logger named \"devmate.\"\n   - Sets the logging level to `INFO`, meaning it will capture all logs at this level and above (e.g., warnings, errors).\n\n3. **File Handler**:\n   - Uses a `RotatingFileHandler` to manage logging in a file (`devmate.log`).\n   - Configured to rotate logs once they reach 1 MB in size and retain the last three log files to manage disk space.\n\n4. **Console Handler**:\n   - Uses a `StreamHandler` to output log messages to the console.\n   - Also set to capture logs at the `INFO` level.\n\n5. **Log Formatting**:\n   - Sets a common format for log messages, including the timestamp, log level, and message.\n\n6. **Handler Addition**:\n   - Adds both file and console handlers to the logger if they haven't already been added, ensuring that logs can be captured in multiple outputs.\n\nThis setup enables effective monitoring and debugging of the application's behavior by keeping a detailed log of its operations.",
  "app/main.py": "The purpose of this Python file is to set up a web server using the FastAPI framework for a project named \"DevMate AI Backend.\" \n\n### Key Functions:\n\n1. **FastAPI Initialization**: It initializes a FastAPI application instance with a specified title.\n\n2. **Static File Serving**: It mounts a directory (`app/static`) to serve static files, allowing access via the `/static` URL path.\n\n3. **Root Route**: It defines a root route (`/`) that serves an HTML file (`index.html`) located in the static directory. This file is read and returned with an HTML response.\n\n4. **API Routes Inclusion**: It includes additional API routes from an external module named `routes`, which is likely intended for handling API requests.\n\nOverall, this file serves both static content (HTML) and API functionality, facilitating web interaction for the application.",
  "app/memory_manager.py": "This Python file is designed to summarize code files and store those summaries in a designated directory for future reference. Its main purpose is to automate the process of summarizing code snippets using the OpenAI API and persist those summaries in JSON format.\n\n### Key Functions:\n\n1. **store_summary(file_path, summary)**: \n   - Stores a summary of a code file in the \"memory\" directory. It creates the directory if it doesn\u2019t exist, names the summary file according to the original file name, and saves the summary in JSON format.\n\n2. **get_all_summaries()**: \n   - Retrieves all previously saved summaries from the \"memory\" directory. It returns a list of summaries if the directory exists and contains JSON files.\n\n3. **summarize_code(code)**: \n   - Uses the OpenAI API to summarize a given code snippet into a short paragraph. It constructs a prompt for the GPT model and returns the summarized output.\n\n4. **process_file_for_memory(file_path)**: \n   - Reads a code file, generates a summary using the `summarize_code` function, and stores the resulting summary using `store_summary`. It also prints a confirmation message once the summary is stored.\n\nOverall, this script facilitates the summarization and organization of code files, aiming to improve the accessibility and understanding of the code by capturing key insights in a structured format.",
  "app/repo_summarizer.py": "The Python file is designed to summarize Python files from a specified GitHub repository and store the summaries in a JSON file. Here are the main components and functions:\n\n### Purpose:\n- To fetch all Python files from a GitHub repository, summarize their content using OpenAI\u2019s API, and save these summaries for future reference.\n\n### Key Functions:\n\n1. **get_all_files(repo, path=\"\")**:\n   - Recursively collects all `.py` files in the given GitHub repository.\n   - Returns a list of file contents.\n\n2. **summarize_repo(repo_name: str)**:\n   - Fetches all Python files from a specified repository using the GitHub API.\n   - For each Python file, it generates a summary of its purpose and key functions by sending the code to OpenAI\u2019s API.\n   - Stores the summaries in a JSON file located at `/memory/repo_summary.json`.\n   - Handles errors in summarization and creates a directory if it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n### Additional Details:\n- The GitHub and OpenAI clients are initialized using API keys fetched from environment variables.\n- The summaries are structured in a dictionary called `summaries`, which maps file paths to their respective summaries. \n\nOverall, this file automates the process of analyzing Python code in repositories and creating concise summaries for easier understanding and reference.",
  "app/routes.py": "This Python file defines a FastAPI router that provides endpoints for reviewing code, generating test cases, updating documentation, and handling GitHub repository operations. Key components and functions include:\n\n### Purpose\nThe main goal is to facilitate code review, testing, and documentation for Python snippets, leveraging OpenAI's capabilities. It also offers functions to interact with GitHub repositories.\n\n### Key Functions\n1. **CodeRequest Schema**: Defines the request structure that contains a single attribute for code (string).\n\n2. **/review Endpoint**: \n   - Receives Python code and requests a review from OpenAI, suggesting improvements.\n   - Logs the code length and handles exceptions, returning errors clearly.\n   - Summarizes the code and stores the summary in memory.\n\n3. **/testgen Endpoint**: \n   - Generates Python unit tests using pytest for the provided code, ensuring only code (no explanations) is returned.\n   - Logs relevant information about the request.\n\n4. **/docupdate Endpoint**: \n   - Updates or improves documentation and inline comments for the provided code using OpenAI.\n   - Logs the request, simplifying the enhancement of code readability.\n\n5. **/list_repo Endpoint**: \n   - Lists all files in a specified GitHub repository, integrating with a function to fetch repository file information.\n\n6. **/summarize_repo Endpoint**: \n   - Summarizes all Python files within a specified GitHub repository and saves this summarization in memory.\n   - Logs the repository being summarized.\n\n### Additional Features\n- Uses **dotenv** to load API keys securely.\n- Utilizes a custom logger for logging purposes.\n- Integrates functions from other modules, like `summarize_code`, `store_summary`, and GitHub client functionalities. \n\nOverall, this structure supports developers in enhancing code quality, testing, and documentation efficiently."
