  "app/__init__.py": "Please provide the content or details of the Python file you would like summarized.",
  "app/github_client.py": "The purpose of this Python file is to list the top-level files in a specified GitHub repository using the GitHub API.\n\n### Key Functions:\n1. **Imports**: It imports the `Github` class from the `github` module and the `os` module for accessing environment variables.\n2. **Function `list_repo_files(repo_name: str)`**:\n   - **Input**: Takes the name of the repository as a string.\n   - **Environment Variable**: Retrieves a GitHub personal access token from the environment variables.\n   - **GitHub Connection**: Creates a `Github` object using the token to authenticate.\n   - **Repository Access**: Fetches the specified repository using its name.\n   - **File Listing**: Gets a list of top-level files in the repository and returns their paths as a list.\n\nOverall, it facilitates easy access to repository file structures via the GitHub API.",
  "app/main.py": "This Python file sets up a FastAPI application intended as the backend for \"DevMate AI.\" \n\n### Key Functions:\n\n1. **Initialize FastAPI**: Creates an instance of the FastAPI application with a specified title.\n   \n2. **Serve Static Files**: Mounts a static directory at the `/static` endpoint to serve static files from `app/static`.\n\n3. **Root Route**: Defines a root route (`\"/\"`) that reads and serves an HTML file (`index.html`) from the static directory as an HTML response.\n\n4. **API Routes Inclusion**: Includes additional API routes from an external module (`routes`), allowing the application to handle various web requests beyond the root and static files. \n\n### Purpose:\nThe file serves as a basic web server setup, providing a frontend interface through an HTML page and capabilities for API interactions.",
  "app/memory_manager.py": "This Python file primarily serves to summarize code files and store their summaries in a designated \"memory\" directory. Here are its key functions:\n\n1. **Store Summary (`store_summary`)**: This function takes a file path and a summary, creates a JSON file in the `memory` directory, and saves the summarized information about the file.\n\n2. **Retrieve All Summaries (`get_all_summaries`)**: It fetches all saved summaries from the `memory` directory, returning them as a list. If no summaries exist, it returns an empty list.\n\n3. **Summarize Code (`summarize_code`)**: This function uses OpenAI's API to generate a summary of the provided code snippet, forming a brief description in response to a prompt.\n\n4. **Process File for Memory (`process_file_for_memory`)**: This reads a specified code file, calls the summarization function, and saves the resulting summary using the store function. It also prints confirmation of the memory storage.\n\nOverall, the file integrates OpenAI\u2019s capabilities to dissect and summarize code, while also managing the storage and retrieval of these summaries.",
  "app/routes.py": "The provided Python file is a FastAPI application that offers several endpoints to assist with Python code analysis and enhancement. It leverages the OpenAI API for code review, test generation, and documentation improvements. Here's a summary of its purpose and key functions:\n\n### Purpose\nThe file serves as a back-end service that facilitates the following tasks for Python code:\n1. Reviewing code for improvements.\n2. Generating unit tests using pytest.\n3. Enhancing documentation by adding or improving docstrings and inline comments.\n4. Listing files in a specified GitHub repository.\n\n### Key Functions\n1. **Configuration**: Utilizes `dotenv` to load environment variables containing the OpenAI API key.\n\n2. **APIRouter**: Creates a router for the API endpoints.\n\n3. **Request Schema**: Defines a `CodeRequest` class using Pydantic that expects a string of Python code.\n\n4. **Endpoints**:\n   - **`/review`**: \n     - Analyzes the submitted Python code and suggests improvements.\n     - Summarizes the code and stores that summary optionally.\n  \n   - **`/testgen`**:\n     - Generates Python unit tests using the `pytest` framework for the provided code.\n\n   - **`/docupdate`**:\n     - Generates or improves docstrings and inline comments for the given Python code.\n  \n   - **`/list_repo`**:\n     - Retrieves and returns a list of files from a specified GitHub repository using a helper function (`list_repo_files`).\n\n### Error Handling\n- The `/review` endpoint includes error handling that returns a clear error message if an exception occurs while processing the request. \n\nOverall, this Python file provides a set of tools to enhance Python code quality, facilitate testing, and improve documentation, while integrating with external services like OpenAI and GitHub."
